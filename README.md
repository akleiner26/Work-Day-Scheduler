# Work-Day-Scheduler
One of the biggest truths for a web developer is that a task will never be fully completed with one tool. As computer science has advanced over the years, a plethora of languages, utilities, and resources have been created to assist coders in making sites more dynamic, aesthetically pleasing, and functional. With this site,this becomes evident with the use of html, in conjuction with CSS, JavaScript, and an assortment of what is known as third party APIs.

An API is "a set of functions and procedures allowing the creation of applications that access the features or data of an operating system, application, or other service." *2. This site uses the third party API system moment.js in order to access the user's local system clock to make the site dynamic. The first thing a site visitor will notice is a live clock on display at the top of the screen, so that they can easily access their present task. In order to make this site even more accessible, the colors of the text cells will change according to the time of day. All past events will be greyed out, present events will be in red, and future events will be in green.

What this site best represents is the ability to make a site higher functioning using combinations of different tools. By using JavaScript in cunjunction with the third party API moment.js, I was able to create an interactive work day scheduler that becomes practical for any user.
